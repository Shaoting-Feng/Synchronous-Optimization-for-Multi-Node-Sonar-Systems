# System Optimization of Synchronous in Multi-node Sonar System

This project explores the reliability, average life, and optimal node quantity of a multi-node sonar system, including master-slave nodes and a clock bus. Using statistics and Monte Carlo methods, we model the system hierarchically and employ a variable-step Markov chain to analyze its properties.

## Introduction
This project investigates a multi-node sonar system's synchronous clock mechanism. Due to the system's strong randomness, extensive simulations using the Monte Carlo method are required.

## System Modeling
The system is modeled hierarchically, and a variable-step Markov chain is used to explore its properties. This approach helps in understanding the system's behavior and identifying failure reasons.

## Optimization Scheme
After analyzing the system's failure reasons, a dual-bus system is proposed as an optimization scheme. This new system is compared with the original system's theoretical availability values.

## Simulation Results
The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dual-bus system in improving the system's reliability and average life.

## Conclusion
The dual-bus system offers a significant improvement over the original system, providing better reliability and longer average life for the multi-node sonar system.
