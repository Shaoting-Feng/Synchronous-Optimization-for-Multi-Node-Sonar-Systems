# System-Optimization-of-Synchronous-in-Multi-node-Sonar-System

This paper takes a certain multi-node sonar system including master-slave nodes and
clock bus as the research object, and uses statistics and Monte Carlo methods to explore the reliability,
average life and corresponding optimal nodes of the synchronous clock mechanism in the system.
quantity. Due to the strong randomness of the system, a large number of simulations using the Monte
Carlo method are required. In this paper, the system is modeled hierarchically, and the variable-step
Markov chain is used to explore the properties of the system. After analyzing the system failure reasons,
this paper proposes a dual-bus system as an optimization scheme, and compares the availability
theoretical values of the original system.
